# Prosper Loan Analysis

This project is on a data set from Prosper, which is America’s first marketplace lending platform, with over $7 billion in funded loans. 

### About The dataset
This data set contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, borrower employment status, borrower credit history, and the latest payment information. The main purpose of this project is to summarize the characteristics of variables that can affect the loan status and to get some ideas about the relationships among multiple variables using summary statistics and data visualizations.Some of the features were not used in this project.

### Summary of Findings
The BorrowerAPR is has a negative correlation with the LoanOriginalAmount, Term and ProsperRating.
ProsperRAting is highly influenced by income, homeownership, debt-to-income ratio and employment status.
High income earners seemed to borrow more when long-term loans are involved, increasing their debt to income ratio. Hence, an increase in APR might be a great way to disincentivize 'overborrowing'. On the other hand, decreasing APR by term might be a great way to encourage low-rated borrowers to take long-term loans — those that they would be able to fully repay.



### Key Insights for Presentation
1. There is a negative correlation between BorrowerAPR and LoanOriginalAmount. There is a moderate positive correlation between Term and LoanOriginalAmount
2. The employed, full-time employed, and self-employed borrowers have higher monthly incomes, obtain higher loan amounts, and enjoy lower Borrower APRs than the part-time, retired, and unemployed borrowers. The Employed also have lower debt-to-income-ratios.
